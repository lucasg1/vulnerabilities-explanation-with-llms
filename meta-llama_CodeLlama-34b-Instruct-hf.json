            "fix": "To fix this vulnerability, the system should be modified to properly validate the user's access to the data or record being accessed. This could involve implementing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms, as well as ensuring that the system properly checks the user's access permissions before allowing them to access the data or record."

            "fix": "To fix this vulnerability, the verifyResponse method should be modified to verify the signature of the response before processing it. This can be done by using a digital signature algorithm, such as RSA or ECDSA, to verify the signature of the response. Additionally, the method should check the validity of the assertion subject and the SOAP entry for the partner to ensure that they are valid and match the expected values."
